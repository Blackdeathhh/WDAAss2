Make sure that if the session is expired, remove that info from SESSION. That will make the client know their session has expired. Best have a function that does that for us.

make logout page take GET; abnormal or normal, abnormal for errors

Timezone stuff
Titles for all pages, make sure that you keep the topbar AFTER the title!


Permission level can also be updated by going to your own profile.

OH YEAH Restrict thread creation in threads by permission level, not just "yes/no" and yu can override it if you're privileged enough

With that, the new permission levels we could have...
0 - Demoted user
	Just about nothing. Only viewing profiles, forums, and threads.
1 - Standard user
	Standard stuff you can do now. Make posts and threads and upload your avatar and modify your details.
2 - Privileged user
	All of the above plus...I dunno.
3 - Super user?
4 - Moderator
	All of the above plus the ability to move/lock/delete threads. Edit/Delete posts. Issue bans up to a limit of 1 week.
5 - Super Moderator
	All of the above plus the ability to issue bans for an unlimited period of time.
10 - Administrator
	All of the above plus the ability to Modify/Move/Delete forums. Ability to modify permission levels of anyone else.
